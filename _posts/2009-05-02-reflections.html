        <p>What do credit card companies and banks know about your habits, your personality, your friends, your lovers?
        This work explores the information obtainable simply from your financial transactions. From your carbon footprint
        to your daily habits, we show that quite a bit of information can be learned from this readily available
        data source, without requiring extra instrumentation or sensors.</p>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>

        <p>August 2008 - My research project starts growing and Jen suggests we aim to submit this to CHI </p>
        <p>September 2008 - Jen and I finish the paper and submit the work to CHI. It is accepted!</p>

            <small>  Carbon footprint of a six person household (monthly), obtained from
                examining utility bills. The
                footprint rises in the winter, (the home’s walls are not
                insulated) and falls in the summer (due to the shade of several
                large trees). This household does not drive or fly much.
