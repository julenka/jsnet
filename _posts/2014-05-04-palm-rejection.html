        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            Tablet computers are often called upon to emulate classical pen-and-paper input. However, touchscreens typically lack
            the means to distinguish between legitimate stylus and finger touches and touches with the palm or other parts of
            the hand. Users are then forced to rest their palms elsewhere or hover above the screen, resulting in ergonomic and
            usability problems. We present a probabilistic touch filtering approach that uses the temporal evolution of touch
            contacts to reject palms. Our system improves upon previous approaches, reducing accidental palm inputs to 0.016 per
            pen stroke, while correctly passing 98% of stylus inputs.

        <h3>Algorithm</h3>

        <p>The <a href="{{site.url}}/{{page.paper}}">paper</a> provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm used, but below
        is a bullet point overview of the algorithm's major components, along with an explanatory figure.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Implemented for iOS, which as of iOS 8 provides <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UITouch_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UITouch/majorRadius">
                touch area support</a>.</li>
            <li>The most useful features used are touch area, touch velocity, distance to other touches.</li>
            <li>After a touch occurs, perform classification using a binary decision tree every 50, 100, 150, ... , 500 ms. </li>
            <li>Each tree is appropriately trained to use only data in that time window.</li>
            <li>Use voting mechanism of current and previous results to get current classification, confidence.</li>
            <li>After 500ms (or touch up, whichever occurs first), perform final classification and finalize either stroke or palm.</li>
        </ul>
