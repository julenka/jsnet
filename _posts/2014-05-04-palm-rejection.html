authors: "Julia Schwarz, Robert Xiao, Jennifer Mankoff, Scott Hudson and Chris Harrison"
proceedings: "In Proceedings of CHI â€˜14"
excerpt: "Presents a new algorithm for discriminating unintentional palm inputs from intentional pen inputs. This algorithm improves over existing palm rejection methods, reducing accidental palm inputs to 0.016 per pen stroke, while correctly passing 98% of stylus inputs."
