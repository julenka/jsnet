authors: "Julia Schwarz, Scott E. Hudson, and Jennifer Mankoff"
proceedings: "In Proceedings of UIST '10"
excerpt: "The first of two papers presenting a radically new input dispatch system for handling inputs with uncertainty (e.g. voice, touch, gesture).
Presents a general input dispatch architecture where interface elements are queried regarding their suitability to handle an event.
The query result is then used to update the likelihood of a particular input event interpretation. All interpretations are considered
before a decision is made."
