            Phone as a Pixel is a scalable, synchronization-free, platform-independent system for creating large, ad-hoc
            displays from a collection of smaller devices. In contrast to most tiled-display systems, the only requirement
            for participation is for devices to have an internet connection and a web browser. Thus, most smartphones,
            tablets, laptops and similar devices can be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Phone as a Pixel uses a color-transition encoding scheme to identify and locate displays.
            This approach has several advantages: devices can be arbitrarily arranged, can join and leave at any time,
            and infrastructure consists of a single conventional camera.
            Further, additional devices can join at any time without recalibration.

            A similar project called <a href="http://seb.ly/work/pixelphones/" target="_blank   ">PixelPhones</a> was done concurrently by Seb Lee-Delisle,
            whose impressive system has been demonstrated to work on thousands of displays.

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
            Phone as a Pixel uses a color-transition encoding scheme to identify and locate displays. A user joins the crowd display
            by visiting a webpage, which assigns her device a unique ID. The user's device then flashes this ID using a color
            sequence (Figure 1). A camera pointing at the crowd decodes these flashes into device IDs. After performing clustering
            and localization, the system can know approximately where in the camera's field of view a particular device is located.
            The system then assigned a color to a device ID by indexing into a corresponding picture or animation that it wishes to display.

            <small>Figure 1. A device's ID is encoded using color transitions between red, green, and blue. A transition from
            red to green, green to blue, or blue to red represents a 1, a transition in the other direction (red to blue,
                blue to green, green to red) represents a 0.</small>

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>July 2011 - Initial discussion of idea with Paul Dietz over lunch. I decide to do this as a side project.</p>
        <p>August 2011 - Development begins in earnest when I get back from internship at Microsoft Research, David takes over the code and improves it significantly</p>
        <p>September 2011 - Filming of demos and writing commences. Submission to CHI at the end of the month, it is accepted!</p>
