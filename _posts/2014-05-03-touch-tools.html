title: "TouchTools: Leveraging Familiarity and Skill with Physical Tools to Augment Touch Interaction"
category: publications
icon: "/assets/cards/touchtools.png"
authors: "Chris Harrison, Robert Xiao, Julia Schwarz and Scott E. Hudson"
proceedings: "In Proceedings of CHI ‘14"
excerpt: "The core idea behind TouchTools is to draw upon user familiarity
 with tools from the real world and bring them to interactive surfaces. To invoke a tool, users replicate a
tool’s real-world grasp and press it to the screen as though it were physically present."

            TouchTools is a gesture design language and recognition engine that invokes tools or commands by mimicking
            how we grab tools in the real world. It is a tiny step into the <a href="http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/">
            future of interaction design</a> as envisioned
            by Bret Victor (we are, unfortunately, still touching glass).
        </p>
        <p>
            A second contribution of TouchTools is the recognition algorithm. Rather than classifying on touch down,
            we wait 50ms after an initial touch to allow all touches to hit the screen, then compute rotation-invariant
            features on this set of points, and feed these into a support vector machine (SVM). Details are available
            in the <a href="assets/touch-tools/harrison-chi14-touchtools.pdf">paper</a>.

            To ensure credit is given where credit is due, much of the code for TouchTools was developed by <a href="http://robertxiao.ca/">
            Robert Xiao</a>.
            This work was very much a collaboration and I'm honored to have been a part of it.

            Demos of TouchTools are available for both iOS and Android. To see a demo of this work, please contact info@qeexo.com

            <small>TouchTools is especially compelling on large displays such as interactive whiteboards. Here you see
                how I can change tools (pen and eraser) without needing to reach over and press any buttons.
