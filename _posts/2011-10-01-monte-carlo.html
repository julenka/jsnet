proceedings: "In Proceedings of UIST '11"
excerpt: "The second of three papers presenting a radically new input dispatch system for handling inputs with uncertainty (e.g. voice, touch, gesture).
Tracks the likelihood of interface alternatives by deterministically simulating hundreds of input alternatives and aggregating results.
This allows develpers to build uncertain interfaces without having to think probabilistically."

        <p>
            This paper is the second of three research papers published as part of my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications/2015/06/05/dissertation/">PhD thesis</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            One challenge I ran into when implementing the demos for my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications/2010/10/02/probabilistic-input/">
            first paper</a> was that I found it difficult to
            track that state of any user interface element that had more than two states.  The aim of this paper was to modify the initial architecture to
            make it easy for developers to track the probabilistic state of user interface elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key insight in this paper was to use  a Monte Carlo approach to maintain a
            probabilistically accurate description of the user interface that can be used to make informed choices about
            actions. Samples are used to approximate the distribution of possible inputs, possible interactor states that
            result from inputs, and possible actions (callbacks and feedback) interactors may execute.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a touch event is often represented as a single point, but in fact the finger is touching an entire area. My system approximates this distribution by generating a collection of individual touch events (Figure 2).

                <small>Figure 1. A single touch is 
                modeled using a cloud of possible touch events. The system simulates what might happen to each possible
                event to decide what to do next.

            </div>
        <p>
            Because each sample is certain, the developer can specify most of the behavior of interactors in a familiar,
            non-probabilistic fashion. This approach retains all the advantages of maintaining information about uncertainty
            while minimizing the need for the developer to work in probabilistic terms. This paper presents a working implementation
            of our framework and illustrates the power of these techniques within a paint program that includes three
            different kinds of uncertain input.

                <small>Probabilistic input events are sampled to produce a collection of possible input events. Each input event is dispatched and interface state is updated. Interface updated, creates a collection of possible actions. These actions are then resolved according to a configurable set of rules.
