title: "Monte Carlo Methods for Managing Interactive State, Action and Feedback Under Uncertainty"
category: publications
icon: "/assets/cards/monte-carlo.png"
authors: "Julia Schwarz, Jennifer Mankoff, Scott E. Hudson, Andy Wilson"
proceedings: "In Proceedings of UIST '11"
excerpt: "The second of two papers presenting a radically new input dispatch system for handling inputs with uncertainty (e.g. voice, touch, gesture).
Tracks the likelihood of interface alternatives by deterministically simulating hundreds of input alternatives and aggregating results.
This allows develpers to build uncertain interfaces without having to think probabilistically."
