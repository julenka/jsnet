excerpt: "Headshot is an application that helps people take better self-photos by detecting faces telling users how to adjust their phone.
I developed this application while an intern at Microsoft, where it won a company-wide application development contest.
The app has been featured in Windows Phone App Store, with over 225,000 downloads as of June 2014."

            Headshot helps you take better pictures of yourself. You specify where you want your head to be when taking a self-portrait, then headshot uses face detection to tell you how to rotate your camera so that your head is in the right place.

            The initial version of this application was written while I was working as an intern at Microsoft Research as part
            of an application development contest. I actually ended up winning the contest, which included
            a $5000 prize for a trip to Hawaii! Speared by this win, I decided to ship the project as an application on Windows Phone.
            While initial versions of the application did not do well in the store, I kept trying, getting feedback and
            revising my work accordingly. Eventually the app caught the eye of the Windows Store curators, and has since been
            featured as one of the recommended camera apps for Windows Phone.

            Writing this application was a really rewarding experience. Not only did I gain technical experience in writing
            my own <a href="http://facedetectwp7.codeplex.com">face detection library</a>,
            I learned about the value of polish, patience, and of sharing your work to get feedback.  For a full story about the development process for the application, please see
            a <a href="http://codingbeta.notjulie.com/the-story-of-headshot/" target="_blank">blog post</a> I wrote detailing the story of Headshot.

            While this application was a solo endeavour, my boyfriend <a href="http://www.davidklionsky.com">David</a>
            and I have written several applications for Windows phone and Windows 8 as part of <a href="http://www.electricsquashstudios.com" target="_blank">Electric Squash Studios</a>.
            Collectively, our applications have over half a million downloads, headshot alone makes up half of these downloads.
