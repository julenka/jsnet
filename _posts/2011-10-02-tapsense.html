title: "TapSense: Enhancing	 Finger  Interaction on  Touch  Surfaces"
category: publications

authors: "Chris Harrison, Julia Schwarz, and Scott E. Hudson"
proceedings: "In Proceedings of UIST '11"
excerpt: "I helped develop a touchscreen that detects not only touch location, but touch type.
This is accomplished by performing acoustic analysis when a finger (or other material) strikes the screen.
 The technology is now being commercialized by the CMU spinoff <a href='http://www.qeexo.com'>Qeexo</a>."

            TapSense is an enhancement to conventional interactive surfaces that allows not only localization of inputs,
            but also provides information about the object coming into contact with it. This information is derived by
            segmenting and classifying the sounds resulting from the impact of the object with the surface.

            TapSense takes advantage of the fact that different materials have unique acoustic signatures, allowing for
            different tools and tangibles to be recognized. Additionally, the diverse anatomy of our fingers allows
            different parts to be recognized – including the tip, pad, nail and knuckle - opening several new interaction
            opportunities for finger touch input.
