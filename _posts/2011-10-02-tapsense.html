            TapSense is an enhancement to conventional interactive surfaces that allows not only localization of inputs,
            but also provides information about the object coming into contact with it. This information is derived by
            segmenting and classifying the sounds resulting from the impact of the object with the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
            TapSense takes advantage of the fact that different materials have unique acoustic signatures, allowing for
            different tools and tangibles to be recognized. Additionally, the diverse anatomy of our fingers allows
            different parts to be recognized – including the tip, pad, nail and knuckle - opening several new interaction
            opportunities for finger touch input.

        <h3>Commercialization</h3>
        
        <p>
            Qeexo licenses FingerSense technology to OEMs. As of December 2015, the company is partnering with Chinese giants Huawei and Alibaba.
            FingerSense has shipped on multiple Huawei phone models, including flagship models like the P8 and Honor 7 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSQ63edU_cjrzjbi6k-DJ3bbZ55Z_nnPh">example commercials</a> that include FingerSense).
            The company now has about 15 employees, has raised over $4M in funding, and has three offices worldwide.
