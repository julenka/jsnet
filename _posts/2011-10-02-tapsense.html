authors: "Chris Harrison, Julia Schwarz, and Scott E. Hudson"
proceedings: "In Proceedings of UIST '11"
excerpt: "I helped develop a touchscreen that detects not only touch location, but touch type.
This is accomplished by performing acoustic analysis when a finger (or other material) strikes the screen.
 The technology is now being commercialized by the CMU spinoff <a href='http://www.qeexo.com'>Qeexo</a>."
