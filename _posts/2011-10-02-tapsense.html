            TapSense is an enhancement to conventional interactive surfaces that allows not only localization of inputs,
            but also provides information about the object coming into contact with it. This information is derived by
            segmenting and classifying the sounds resulting from the impact of the object with the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
            TapSense takes advantage of the fact that different materials have unique acoustic signatures, allowing for
            different tools and tangibles to be recognized. Additionally, the diverse anatomy of our fingers allows
            different parts to be recognized – including the tip, pad, nail and knuckle - opening several new interaction
            opportunities for finger touch input.

            This work has seen press coverage from many sources including
            <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/qeexo/" target="_blank">Wired</a>,

        <p>
            The technology is currently being commercialized as a part of a company I co-founded, <a href="http://www.qeexo.com" target="_blank">Qeexo</a>.
            The technology has been renamed "FingerSense", the video to the right gives a detailed overview of this promising technology.

        <h3>Commercialization</h3>
        
        <p>The business model for our company is not to make an app but to integrate FingerSense as a core component of a phone.
        We are partnering with OEMs to implement the FingerSense engine at the system level.
            We license the FingerSense technology to OEMs in return for giving OEMs the chance to include applications that leverage knuckle knocks and other touch types.
            </p>
        <p>
            The main reason for this business model is impact.
            Implementing FingerSense at the application layer would not reach enough people.
            Only by changing the core components of mobile devices will we be able to revolutionize touch. </p>
        <p> As of July 2014, the company has 10 full-time employees, has raised over $2M in funding, and has worked with some of the largest phone
        manufacturers in the world. Working at Qeexo has given me the chance to travel the world, manage and grow an engineering team,
        learn about and manage the commercial QA (quality assurance) process, and understand what goes into making a commercial product. </p>

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>January 2010 - Chris and I work on the very first version of FingerSense as part of my course project
            for Applied Machine Learning. I write most of the application
        and evaluation code, Chris works on building the touch table, giving feedback, running the study, and writing the paper.</p>
        <p>March 2010 - First submission to UIST is rejected.</p>
        <p>March 2011 - Submit again to UIST, this time focusing more on mobile and sensing finger types. Accepted!</p>
        <p>June 2012 - Sang Lee approaches Chris and myself, asking if we want to start a company.</p>
        <p>September 2012 - Chris, Sang, Minsoo (angel investor) and I come up with a name (Qeexo) and sign incorporation docs.</p>

        <!--<p>October 2012 - Robert finishes first prototype, Robert and I begin feverishly writing prototypes and demos.</p>-->
        <!--<p>May 2013 - We settle into our offices with our first employee, Greg. Taihei joins in August</p>-->
        <!--<p>November 2013 - Two adventures in Korea related to implemented prototypes of FingerSense with an OEM </p>-->
        <!--<p>January 2014 - Two more engineers join the team: Android Kernel (Leandro) and QA/Data Collection (Jim)</p>-->
        <!--<p>March 2014 - By now we have implemented FingerSense for over 5 partners, our second big implementation just finished with another OEM.</p>-->
        <!--<p>April 2014 - Close $2M Series A round.</p>-->
        <p>July 2014 - Qeexo is almost two! We now have raised over $2M in funding, have 10 employees and are actively working on commercial collaborations.
            Qeexo has led to several fruitful research projects and many adventures. Wouldn't have traded the experience for anything.</p>
